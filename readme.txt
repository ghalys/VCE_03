## 🌍 About Our Website
We created a website that transforms the Erasmus experience from the very beginning.

- Connect more easily with other Erasmus students **before** the exchange starts.
- A **3D space** allows users to express themselves more effectively than a simple text chat.
- Users can **display and change their country flag**.
- This was part of a school project where the chat system was **coded from scratch**.
